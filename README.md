# Lab5: Intro To Arduino
This lab introduces arduino.

## Goals & Required Submissions
### Goals
- Understand what is an arduino
- Understand why you might use an arduino
- Download Arduino IDE. Set up Arduino on your computers
- Write LED Blink Code
- Discuss Building a Circuit. Build Circuit. 

### Submissions
Submit your code in a folder labeled `Lab5_FirstName_LastName` on google drive, or make a github folder, fork this README, then pull request to add the link to your file. 

1. Commented Arduino code with a basic blinking pattern, as zip file or Github submission. 

(  2, 3, 4 in a separte document in the google drive or in the github readme ).  

2. Picture of your setup. Link to a video of your arduino showing the basic blinking pattern - can upload on google photos using your massive ammount of UMaine Storage. 

3. Short explanation of why your circuit works, can include diagram

4. What would you be interested in doing with an Arduino? Write a paragraph, describing either muliple projects of interest or describing one project in depth.

5. **Extra** Use Arduinio LED to send a Morse Code message. Class use recommended. Zip & Google Drive or Github.
